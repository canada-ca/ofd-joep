## Purpose

Following the redaction of the [Open First Whitepaper](https://github.com/canada-ca/Open_First_Whitepaper/blob/master/README.md), the Open First Day will highlight how the Government of Canada has been and will continue adopting Open Standards, using and contributing to Open Source Software, thus supporting an open culture and open markets.

Government of Canada departments have been working openly and in collaboration with the population as well as with private companies to enhance the quality of their service offerings for all Canadians using Open Source Software and Open Standards.

This day will provide an opportunity for the various actors of the public service, private sector and the population to discuss and engage together in order to exchange on the progress made over the last years and how we can continue to add value to our activities and services together.

## Format of the day

The Open First Day will offer a wide variety of activities and sessions for participants to learn and engage with other government employees as well as with private sector representatives and members of the public.

In order to help capture the breadth of what is in scope, we have put together multiple streams.

The first stream is the general, or "executive", stream which is geared towards a higher level view of what Open Government is; how we can use and contribute to Open Source Software.

There will also be three more specific streams with sessions where engagement with the participants will be encouraged.

- The Rules stream will have a session around the legislative clarifications and guidance on the use and contribution to Open Source Software.
- The Tools stream will offer sessions around the decentralized version control system Git and how it is possible to leverage Open Source Software at every layer of an application.
- The People stream will explore the work done by various departments in terms of crowdsourcing and open collaboration as well as how Open Source Software can be leveraged in such initiatives.

Finally, the unconference stream will offer a moderated space for all to exchange on topics of interest for the people present that day. Our team of moderators will start the day with an exercise that will provide a chance to gauge what topics are of importance to the participants on site and will go on to build the agenda of the day around these.

For the people who are already familiar with these topics, a series of networking activities will be held during the day to help support a greater cohesion of the community of practice as well as the external service providers. Such activities include networking activity during lunchtime, on-demand matchmaking meetings and an after event social mixer.
