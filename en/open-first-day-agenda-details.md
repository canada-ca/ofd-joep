#### Conference-In-A-Box

- The Conference-in-a-box is designed to provide you with the materials you need to organize a 1 day conference to run parallel to the Open First Day on September 28, 2018  with your colleagues
- Your conference can include
  - A group viewing of the webcast portions of the conference
  - Group exercises that you can conduct with your participants
- To run your own conference:
  - Reach out to the Open Source, IT, business, program and policy communities by twitter, email or GCCollab to let them know that you are hosting your own event
  - Plan: decide to watch the conference in Ottawa, run your own activities or you can do a mix of both.  
  - If you decide to watch the conference in Ottawa, here are some helpful tips to organize a viewing party:
    - Reach out to colleagues to see who would be interested in viewing the event
    - Reserve a boardroom
    - Arrive a few minutes before the conference to set up your computer for the live stream
    - Clink on the link: Enjoy and share
  - If you decide to run your own activities, here are some topics you could discuss:
    - What are the rules and guidance in your department based on:
      - Using Open Source Software?
      - Contributing to Open Source Software?
      - Releasing your department source code with an Open Source licence to the public?
    - Are there any default open standards adopted by your organization?
    - Who can authorize the release of GC source code as open source in your organization?
    - Is there an open source working group in your organization?
    - What resources do you have to procure/acquire open source software in your organization?
      - What is the process to acquire software that doesn’t have a cost?
      - How do you assess Open Source Software:
        - Security (SA&A, TRA, etc.)
        - Accessibility
  - If you decide to do a mix of both you could stream one portion of the conference in Ottawa and then plan some activities of your own.
  - Get creative! You can use paper, markers, large dry erase boards etc. to help facilitate your activities of your own!
  - Enjoy and share!

##### Jeff McAffer

Jeff McAffer has over 25 years experience leading impactful high-performance matrix managed software development teams. His main interest is in "platforms" that enable people to create and deploy extensible systems. In particular, as the Director of Microsoft's Open Source Programs Office, Jeff is driving Microsoft's engineering practices and engagement with open source communities. He was one of the founders and architects of the open source Eclipse Tooling and Runtime efforts and was a key community and ecosystem builder from Eclipse’s inception as well as authoring several books and being a prominent speaker in the Eclipse and OSGi community.

Over his career Jeff has worked in domains including modular runtimes, integrated development environments, language design, distributed and massively parallel systems, simulation, expert systems and virtual machine design. Working in large corporations and small startups he has filled the roles of CTO, founder/entrepreneur, director and manager as well as visionary, architect, project/team leader, designer and implementer. He has deep experience in open source projects (Eclipse), open specifications (OSGi, JCP, IETF, ANSI), industrial-strength products as well as speculative research projects.

#### Description

Open source is fundamental to the modern software process and culture. Building software in an open world requires a different mindset, one that accepts depending on thousands of components you did not write, having teams of developers open sourcing their own code, or contributing to other projects. At the same time, the compliance, security, and supply chain demands around software are increasing. Organizations looking to manage the scale and scope of these engagements need coordinated efforts. This talk outlines the challenges in doing open source at scale in a broad, diversified organization, and looks at policy and tooling approaches that both unleash the opportunities and manage the risks, as well as techniques for building an open and collaborative culture.

- Room: Foundry
- Format: Presentation with Workshop

#### Speaker

##### Alexandra Haggert

Project Manager, Public Services Branch

Library and Archives Canada

#### Description

Library and Archives Canada (LAC) has spent the last few years determining how to harness the “wisdom of the crowd” to solve problems related to accessibility, discoverability and usability of its enormous collection of historic records. One of the key results (so far!) is Co-Lab. Integrated with LAC’s new Collection Search Beta tool, Co-Lab allows the public to tag, transcribe, translate and describe digitized images – whether they be photographs, diary entries, maps, government memos or more!

So what’s next? Join us for an interactive workshop on a wide variety of topics – from citizen science/crowdsourcing in government, to the release of Co-Lab’s source code for use by other institutions, to how LAC should proceed in building its collaboration tools.

### Open Projects at DEIL

#### Exploring the potential of open data using an “open project” approach

#### Details

- Time: 13:00
- Duration: 55 minutes
- Room: Foundry
- Format: Presentation with Workshop

#### Speaker

Data Exploration and Integration Lab Team, Centre for Special Business Project

Statistics Canada

#### Description

Over the last few years, the Data Exploration and Integration Lab (DEIL) at Statistics Canada has conducted an increasing amount of work using various open source tools, open data, and open code. For instance, since 2016, DEIL has implemented tools and project solutions on its GitHub account, providing and sharing code under an open source license. In January 2018, DEIL began exploring the potential of integrating open data into coherent and standardized datasets. This exploration and experience has given rise to the idea of using an “open project” approach.

This workshop will engage the audience with practical examples of “open projects”, that is, projects that, to the extent possible, make use of open software, open code, Open Standards, open data, and open project management tools. The focus will be on the integration of buildings and business records, using exclusively open microdata. The preliminary results obtained to date are very encouraging and more can be achieved in a collaborative environment.

The workshop will discuss the potential and benefits of working as an open project, the challenges that are encountered and the possible solutions. For instance, some of the integration solutions are developed in Python and the GNU/Linux operating system to allow for a more fluid development platform, which was found to simplify the data processing framework. Availability and accuracy of the data will be also discussed. An open project framework permits all participants to actively engage in the current and future development of the ongoing work. The session will provide simple hands-on examples on how to contribute to such initiatives.

##### Stephen Walli

Stephen is a technical executive, a founder and consultant, a writer and author, a systems developer, a software construction geek, and a standards diplomat. He has worked in the IT industry since 1980 as both customer and vendor.

He was a Distinguished Technologist at Hewlett Packard Enterprise, technical director at the Outercurve Foundation, founded a start-up, and has been a writer and consultant. He has been around open source software for almost 30 years and blogs about open source software, standards, and the business of software.

#### Description

Open Source Software is collaboratively developed and liberally licensed. Open source collaboration is ultimately about engineering economics. Every development manager understands build vs buy. With interesting buckets of collaborative technology, one gets build vs. buy vs. borrow + share. Sharing is key, not out of altruism, but because forks are expensive and contributing means maintaining the smallest fork possible while hardening the software in use. Building strong communities is essential and there are well understood on ramps to success. This talk looks at those on ramps, why they work, and offers cautionary tales about open source business models and the lack thereof.
