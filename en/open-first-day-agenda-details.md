### Open Source at Scale

#### Open Source Program Office

#### Details

- Time: 13:00
- Duration: 30 minutes
- Room: Training Room
- Format: Presentation

#### Speaker

##### Jeff McAffer

#### Description

Open source is fundamental to the modern software process and culture. Building software in an open world requires a different mindset, one that accepts depending on thousands of components you did not write, having teams of developers open sourcing their own code, or contributing to other projects. At the same time, the compliance, security, and supply chain demands around software are increasing. Organizations looking to manage the scale and scope of these engagements need coordinated efforts. This talk outlines the challenges in doing open source at scale in a broad, diversified organization, and looks at policy and tooling approaches that both unleash the opportunities and manage the risks, as well as techniques for building an open and collaborative culture.

### Crowdsourcing contributions – Co-Lab

#### Details

- Time: 10:30
- Duration: 55 minutes
- Room: Foundry
- Format: Presentation with Workshop

#### Speaker

##### Alexandra Haggert

Project Manager, Public Services Branch

Library and Archives Canada

#### Description

Library and Archives Canada (LAC) has spent the last few years determining how to harness the “wisdom of the crowd” to solve problems related to accessibility, discoverability and usability of its enormous collection of historic records. One of the key results (so far!) is Co-Lab. Integrated with LAC’s new Collection Search Beta tool, Co-Lab allows the public to tag, transcribe, translate and describe digitized images – whether they be photographs, diary entries, maps, government memos or more!

So what’s next? Join us for an interactive workshop on a wide variety of topics – from citizen science/crowdsourcing in government, to the release of Co-Lab’s source code for use by other institutions, to how LAC should proceed in building its collaboration tools.

### Open Projects at DEIL

#### Exploring the potential of open data using an “open project” approach

#### Details

- Time: 13:00
- Duration: 55 minutes
- Room: Foundry
- Format: Presentation with Workshop

#### Speaker

Data Exploration and Integration Lab Team, Centre for Special Business Project

Statistics Canada

#### Description

Over the last few years, the Data Exploration and Integration Lab (DEIL) at Statistics Canada has conducted an increasing amount of work using various open source tools, open data, and open code. For instance, since 2016, DEIL has implemented tools and project solutions on its GitHub account, providing and sharing code under an open source license. In January 2018, DEIL began exploring the potential of integrating open data into coherent and standardized datasets. This exploration and experience has given rise to the idea of using an “open project” approach.

This workshop will engage the audience with practical examples of “open projects”, that is, projects that, to the extent possible, make use of open software, open code, Open Standards, open data, and open project management tools. The focus will be on the integration of buildings and business records, using exclusively open microdata. The preliminary results obtained to date are very encouraging and more can be achieved in a collaborative environment.

The workshop will discuss the potential and benefits of working as an open project, the challenges that are encountered and the possible solutions. For instance, some of the integration solutions are developed in Python and the GNU/Linux operating system to allow for a more fluid development platform, which was found to simplify the data processing framework. Availability and accuracy of the data will be also discussed. An open project framework permits all participants to actively engage in the current and future development of the ongoing work. The session will provide simple hands-on examples on how to contribute to such initiatives.

## Unconference Stream

The Open First Day will start with an engagement activity with all participants present for the day. The exercice will provide an opportunity for the people present to highlight their areas of interest and provide the moderators of the unconference stream with the material to prioritize the discussion topics of the day.

A dedicated boardroom will offer a chance to the Open First Day participants to exchange with their peers on subjects that matter to them in a environment moderators by our team.

The results of the initial activity will also help shape the networking activity that will be held during the lunchtime.
